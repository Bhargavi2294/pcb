# --- Placeholder for your PCB Analysis Model ---
# IMPORTANT: This function is a placeholder.
# You will need to replace this with your actual machine learning model
# that can analyze the PCB image and determine quality check requirements
# and certification needs.
# This could involve:
# - Loading a pre-trained image classification model (e.g., trained with TensorFlow, PyTorch)
# - Running inference on the uploaded image
# - Interpreting the model's output to generate the required text.
